# React To-Do List App 📝

This is a simple, user-friendly **To-Do List application** built with **React.js**, styled with **Bootstrap**, and featuring basic **CRUD operations**. The app leverages **React Router** for seamless navigation between different pages like Home, Add Task, and Edit Task. It demonstrates essential concepts in React such as managing state with **hooks**, creating reusable components, and implementing routing to provide a smooth user experience.

- **Routing**: Pages for listing tasks, adding new tasks, and editing tasks, all handled via **React Router**.
- **Bootstrap UI**: Responsive and clean design built with **Bootstrap**, ensuring a polished user experience across devices.
- **Task Persistence**: Uses **Local Storage** to persist tasks even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for responsive and modern web design.
- **React Router**: Library for handling dynamic routing in React apps.
- **Local Storage**: For persisting tasks across sessions to provide data persistence.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary language used to build the application.

How It Works ⚙️
Adding a Task:

On the "Add Task" page, users can fill out the form and submit it to create a new task. The task is then saved in Local Storage and displayed on the task list.
Editing a Task:

Clicking on an "Edit" button on a specific task navigates the user to the "Edit Task" page, where the task can be updated. The updated task replaces the old data in Local Storage.
Deleting a Task:

Clicking the "Delete" button removes the task from the list and updates Local Storage accordingly.
